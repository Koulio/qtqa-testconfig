While attempting to do a dry run of testproject stage forcestage:
 while parsing property `bad_property' (sourced from file projects/testproject/stages/forcestage/properties/bad_property):
here is an unclosed reference: $(foobar
                                       ^
error: got end of string, expected `)' at SCRIPT line LINE.

Normally I would now fail.  However, `forcesuccess' was set in CONFDIR/projects/testproject/stages/forcestage/forcesuccess.
Therefore I'm going to exit successfully.
This probably indicates that this test is known to not yet be stable.
